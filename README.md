# Example PySpark library

Written for a post over at [Dev.to](https://dev.to/dazfuller/unit-testing-your-pyspark-library-e5j). This gives an example of unit testing with PySpark when building libraries. It has been created against [Databricks Runtime 7.3](https://docs.databricks.com/release-notes/runtime/7.3.html) which specifies the same versions of the libraries included here.
